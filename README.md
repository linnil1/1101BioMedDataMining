# 2021 Summer Bio-Datamining

## Week1: Git Homework

Fork, create a branch, answer question, commit, push and finally pull request.

``` bash
bash hw1.sh
```

## Week2: Python Homework

Read vcf and calculate number of ["0/0", "0/1", "1/0", "1/1"] in each chromosome.

``` bash
cd hw2
python3 hw2.easy.py
```

However, the input vcf `APTVCF0921_del_sort_norm_sample_wgstype_contig_sort.vcf`
is not available online
